<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>When I was a kid, I was quite interested in anything about nature and science and was fond of questioning and probing. At that time, a book named One Two Three... Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science which contains a vision about modern physics and mathematics enlightened me to the world of science. With my accumulating knowledge, I began to dream of virtual reality, mechanical ascension, and brain-computer interface. 
<br><br>
After I went to primary school, I was fond of music and began to play a variety of small musical instruments like flute and recorder at school for reputation. I accomplished a level 10 certification for piano in two years and a half and continued to learn further. However, after moving to a new house, there was no longer a condition to play the piano, so I then turned to learning to play oboe.
<br><br>
In my junior high school period I skipped a grade in junior high school, and my scores became much lower than expected so I temporarily abandoned my musical hobby and had to deal with the study of exam subjects. Notwithstanding the huge fall behind in coursework, with hard endeavor, I turned the tables on exam grades and was admitted to one of the top 3 high schools in the city.
<br><br>
During my high school period, there was a financial problem in my family. As a result, I had to take part in the Physics Olympic competition without attending any related courses, and only got the third prize. 
<br><br>
With unexpectedly poor performance in the Chinese language in the college entrance examination, I was admitted to Shandong University.  For the first two years of study, I was assigned to a tutor who was so old that he retired thereafter, and I didn't even feel his existence. It wasn't in the third year of my bachelor's study until I learned about the graduation project together with the innovation program. My program was on Noninstructive Load Monitoring which is a blind source separating problem. At first factorial hidden Markov model was applied, and soon I found that
convolutional neural networks could have a better result. I won the first prize of the college for my outstanding undergraduate thesis. However, I believed something wrong: if I could publish a grandiose paper on this, I would have a bright future in applying for a Master's or Ph.D. degree, without browsing anything about the application details on the University web pages.
<br><br>
With this false belief, I struggled with the NILM project and didn't pay attention to the Master admission issue. It wasn't May when I started to realize the problem that some of the admissions had already drawn to their deadline. I found that there was a single vacancy for Master's admission in City University of Hong Kong, and there were only two days until the admission deadline. With a strong will, I prepared my CV and PS and submitted the required application files in 28 hours without sleep and it surprised me that I received the offer two days later.
<br><br>
In my year at CityU, I was exposed to many subjects that were not covered in my undergraduate degree, and their emergence opened a new door for me. However, I continued to insist on this false belief, fixed my head on research and missed the application deadline for the master's thesis, what's worse is that I didn't think it was a problem, and this false belief was finally lifted by my parents two days before I wrote this article so that I would possibly catch up with the deadline of Ph.D. admission.
<br><br>
With the lifted false faith, I suddenly realized what had happened: Three people joined the team and went away, and each of them applied for a patent on my "semi-finished products", I even helped them to finish the patents. But each of them did not even reply a single word to me after they left the team. 
<br><br>
Then I immediately tried to browse the desired Ph.D. program and desired Ph.D. tutor. I sent four emails for Ph.D. vacancy consulting, and I came across a nice tutor who told me that he had no Ph.D. vacancy and kindly told me about my shortcomings reflected from my contacting process with him. With his kind notification, I searched the related things on the internet and decided to build up this personal website.</p> -->
<br><br>
<h2>NILM - The story<h2>
<p>
At first factorial hidden Markov model was applied, but soon I found that someone used neural networks for better results. I used Perlin noise-based waveform synesis to generate the waveforms and found that this method could greatly reduce errors for some appliances that do not have a large total power-on time and switching times. For that, I won the first prize of the college for my outstanding undergraduate thesis. After graduation from the university, I did not stop researching it because I believed that I could publish a grandiose paper on this, not overlapping with any existing ideas and exceeding the best mutations of the original neural network. With that belief, I tried differential inputs, and a multi-head attention hybrid structure they did work but I found some papers that proposed the same ideology and had better outputs than mine. Finally, I believe that the methodology of communication: self-interference cancellation could enhance NILM in some way, and this methodology hasn’t been applied to NILM yet. However, after I applied SIC to the network, and tried to make some improvements to it, the results became even worse.
<br><br>
Things went to the worst when my computer’s HDD suddenly broke unexpectedly, all the data within it was destroyed by the computer’s abnormity behavior. And only one version (SIC is sustained) through my GitHub repository. Without existing reference files, my research went stagnant and then the false belief was discovered by my parents and lifted from me.
<br><br>
Although this research troubles me, I won't simply abandon it. If my PhD application is successfully admitted, I would like to continue trying to publish something about it with the help of the new research group.
